# SpamTitan Control Panel

This is an Open Source Control Panel written in TypeScript and React to interact
with a SpamTitan machine through the [API](https://api-spamtitan.titanhq.com/).
This allows for a more modern interface for your SpamTitan.

This can be easily configured and then spun up on Netlify or your own hosting
environment, and be used to immediately start working with SpamTitan.

Additionally, since this is all open source, you are free to take the pages and
integrate them into your own tool/app.
